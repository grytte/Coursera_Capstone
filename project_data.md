# Description of the Data

The first and most crucial part in spatial analysis is the process of determining which set of features should be included in the analysis. In our case, we considered 4. 

Nearby business. 
  While it's good to park in business districts due to the large number of employees and pedestrians, it’s equally important to check if there’s nearby businesses that are similar to what you’re offering. Intuitively, a higher revenue is expected if no competitors are nearby. Location based data such as this can be retrieved using Foursquare API.

Population density. 
  While a lot of Filipinos are now working from home, a quite large number of Filipinos are now back to work on field or on-site, hence, during working hours it's better to stand-by in residential areas and during rush hours in business districts or in any place with high number of pedestrians. High population density often translates to more potential customers and thus more potential earnings. This data can be easily scrapped from wikipedia or be downloaded from Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) website.

Average income/Household prices. 
  The average price should be within the means or budget of the people near the optimal locations/. If people in a specific street have a limited budget, then offering products/services at an affordable price is far better than offering luxurious products. These features may be mapped with house prices or average household income. These features indicate the purchasing capability of the people residing there. 

Demographics. 
  Demographics such as gender, civil status, and age of a certain city can also provide insights on the usual purchasing behavior of the people residing there. Based on market studies, mobile trucks ( especially foods) profit more by parking in places with a high number of males, students, and young professionals since the possibility of them cooking their own meals are low. Demographics can also be downloaded from PSA’s website.
